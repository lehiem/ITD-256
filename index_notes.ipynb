    "## Anatomy of an Index\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is a distinct structure in the database that is built using [create index]\n",
    "\n",
    "Requires its own disk space\n",
    "Holds a copy of the data reformatted into the index \n",
    "\t- That means an index is redundant \n",
    "\t- Doesn’t change the original data structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to a book index, same information but a quick way to find the information\n",
    "\n",
    "Searching a database index is like searching a printed telephone directory \n",
    "\t- All entries are arranged in a well-defined order (alphabetical)\n",
    "The way entries are added to the telephone directory is by updating the directory after a certain period of time with the next printing which adds the new numbers \n",
    "- You cannot just change the directory because there is no way to update it after it is printed \n",
    "\n",
    "An index cannot wait to update the index, it must adjust to any interests, deletes, or updates to the database. The computer has to keep the index in order without completely moving most of the data.\n",
    "- The solution to this problem is a doubly linked list and a search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding data in an ordered index is fast and easy because the data is sorted, the original data structure is not sorted which is why the index would be useful \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Index Leaf Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of an index is to order data but data cannot be ordered sequentially because an insert statement can change the order and change the whole index.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is establishing a logical order that is not depended on the physical order of the data\n",
    "- The logical order is established via doubly linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "Every node on a doubly linked list has two entries on either side of it (before and after the data)\n",
    "- A new node will be inserted b between two existing nodes, the nodes will update to adjust for the new insert \n",
    "- The nodes location won’t matter because there two entries connected to the node that determines the order\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure is called a doubly linked list because each node refers to the preceding and the following node.\n",
    "- allows database to read index forwards and backwards \n",
    "- inserts can be done without moving large amounts of data \n",
    "Databases use doubly linked lists to connect the so-called index leaf nodes.\n",
    "- a leaf node is stored in the databases smallest storage unit called a database block or page\n",
    "\n",
    "All indexes in the block are the same size, each block contains as much of the index as possible which means index can span over multiple blocks \n",
    "This means index order has two levels, the entries within a leaf node and where the leaf node is within the doubly linked list\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Search Tree (B-Tree) Makes the Index Fast\n",
    "The index leaf nodes are stored in an arbitrary order—the position on the disk does not correspond to the logical position according to the index order.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a telephone book was shuffled and you were looking for Smith and you are at the Robinson page there is no granted that Smith will be the next page and there is no way to find Smith unless you keep searching the pages \n",
    "\n",
    "A balanced search tree or B-tree is a second structure to find entries among unorganized data \n",
    "\n",
    "A branch node corresponds to the biggest value in the respective leaf nodes\n",
    "- The biggest values was 46 in the first leaf node so the first value in the branch node was 46 \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you get the first layer of branch nodes you repeat the process until you have one master single node called the root node\n",
    "- The structure is called a balanced search tree because the distance between the root node and the lead nodes is the same at every point\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a balance search tree is created the database keeps up with any insert, delete, or update to the index\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is very efficient and works quickly even on bigger data sets\n",
    "- Main reason is because the balance of the system lets you find all data in the same number of steps \n",
    "- The second reason is because of the logarithmic growth of the tree depth, the tree depth grows slowly compared to the number of leaf nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in databases with millions of records the tree depth has only been four or five\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slow Indexes, Part I\n",
    "\n",
    "There are cases where index lookup doesn’t work as fast as expected. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Leaf node chain\n",
    "If there are multiple entries of the same thing the database needs to check through the leaf node chain. When there were two entries of 57 the database had to check the next leaf nodes to see if there were any other 57’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "An index look up would have to go through the tree depth and also follow the leaf node chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accessing the table \n",
    " Each leaf node might contain information located in many different table blocks, this means you would need to access additional tables for each hit\n",
    "\n",
    "Index Look Up Steps \n",
    "1. Tree traversal \n",
    "-- has an upper bound, the index depth\n",
    "2. Following the leaf node chain\n",
    "3. Fetching the table data \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 2&3 have no upper bound and that can cause slow index lookup \n"
